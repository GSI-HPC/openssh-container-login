# SSH Container Login

Enable direct login into a container with following `sshd` configuration:

```
AcceptEnv SINGULARITY_CONTAINER
ForceCommand /etc/ssh/sshd_container.sh
```

From the `sshd_config` manual:


> **AcceptEnv**
>
> Specifies what environment variables sent by the client will be copied into
> the session's environ(7). See SendEnv in ssh_config(5) for how to configure
> the client. Note that environment passing is only supported for protocol 2.
> Variables are specified by name, which may contain the wildcard characters
> `*` and `?`. Multiple environment variables may be separated by whitespace or
> spread across multiple AcceptEnv directives. Be warned that some environment
> variables could be used to bypass restricted user environments. For this
> reason, care should be taken in the use of this directive. The default is not
> to accept any environment variables.

The environment variable `SINGULARITY_CONTAINER` optionally defined by a use
select a target container image for login. `ForceCommand` executes the script
[sshd_container.sh][02] to consume this environment variable, validates its input
and lunches a container during `ssh` login.

File                          | Description
------------------------------|-----------------------------------
[sshd_container][01]          | Configuration files (default path `/etc/default/sshd_container`)
[sshd_container.sh][02]       | Login script (default path `/etc/ssh/sshd_container.sh`) 


### Development

Build two simple test singularity containers with [containers.sh](containers.sh).

Work on the login script using you localhost:

```bash
SSHD_CONTAINER_DEBUG=true \
SINGULARITY_CONTAINER=menu \
SSHD_CONTAINER_CONFIG=sshd_container \
        ./sshd_container.sh
```

Bootstrap a test virtual machine using the includes [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile)

Start `sshd` on port 23 in foreground for debugging:

```bash
# start a second instance of sshd in foreground on port 23
vagrant ssh -- sudo /sbin/sshd -d -p 23
# connect via the forwarding port...
vagrant ssh-config > ssh-config
ssh -F ssh-config -p 2223 vagrant@ssh-container
```

Uncomment `systemctl restart sshd.service` in the Vagrantfile to run on the default port.

### Usage

By default `ssh` login launches a container specified with `SSHD_CONTAINER_DEFAULT`:

```
>>> ssh -F ssh-config vagrant@ssh-container   
Container launched: /tmp/debian10.sif
vagrant@centos7:~ >
```

Users can specify a specific container with the variable `SINGULARITY_CONTAINER`:

```bash
>>> SINGULARITY_CONTAINER=/tmp/centos7.sif \
        ssh -F ssh-config -o SendEnv=SINGULARITY_CONTAINER vagrant@ssh-container 
Container launched: /tmp/centos7.sif
vagrant@centos7:~ > 
```

From the `ssh_config` manual:

> **SendEnv**
>
> Specifies what variables from the local environ(7) should be sent to the
> server. Note that environment passing is only supported for protocol 2. The
> server must also support it, and the server must be configured to accept
> these environment variables. Refer to `AcceptEnv` in sshd_config(5) for how
> to configure the server. Variables are specified by name, which may contain
> wildcard characters. Multiple environment variables may be separated by
> whitespace or spread across multiple `SendEnv` directives. The default is not
> to send any environment variables.

Passing `none` in the environment variable will prevent any container from
launch and drop the user into a shell running on the host environment:

```bash
# append to configuration the client SSH configuration
>>> echo "  SendEnv=SINGULARITY_CONTAINER" >> ssh-config
>>> SINGULARITY_CONTAINER=none ssh -F ssh-config vagrant@ssh-container
[vagrant@centos7 ~]$
```

Passing `menu` will present a list of available containers defined in the
[sshd_container][01] configuration:

```bash
>>> SINGULARITY_CONTAINER=menu ssh -F ssh-config vagrant@ssh-container
Available containers
1) /tmp/debian10.sif
2) /tmp/centos7.sif
3) none
Select: 2
Container launched: /tmp/centos7.sif
vagrant@centos7:~ >
```
